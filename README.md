# Spacemacs theme for distraction-free writing


## About

This theme is intended to be used for prose writing, together with the [`distraction-free`](https://github.com/dschoenig/distraction-free) layer for Spacemacs. It is heavily inspired by the colour scheme of iA Writer (which is unfortunately not available for Linux) and is based on the [`monchrome`](https://github.com/fxn/monochrome-theme.el) theme.


## Installation

To use the theme, place `distraction-free-theme` into `~/.emacs.d/private/themes/`
    
The theme be loaded by using the theme selector (`SPC T s`) in Spacemacs. A faster way to switch the theme consists in placing `distraction-free` as one of two themes into the `dotspacemacs-themes` list in your `~/.spacemacs`
    
    dotspacemacs-themes '(spacemacs-dark
                          distraction-free)

The theme may then be switched to with `SPC T n`.
